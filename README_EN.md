> A Telegram multi-account automation panel for check-ins, action workflows, and keyword monitoring.

[中文说明](README.md) · [Health Checks](#health-checks) · [Changelog](#changelog)

TG-SignPulse is a Telegram automation panel. It helps you manage multiple accounts, run auto check-in tasks, and monitor execution logs from a web UI.

> AI-powered: AI actions (vision/math) are integrated and can be used directly in task workflows.

## What Is This Project For?

- Manage multiple Telegram accounts in one place
- Automate check-ins, message sending, and button clicking
- Use AI actions for image recognition and math challenges
- View execution flow logs and recent bot replies
- Run check-ins inside specific Telegram group topics
- Use clipboard bulk task import/export, global proxy fallback, failure notifications, and keyword monitoring
- Run reliably on a VPS for long-term automation

## Highlights

- Multi-account management
- Action sequences: `Send Text`, `Click Text Button`, `Send Dice`, `AI Vision`, `AI Calculate`, `Keyword Monitor`
- Topic check-ins for specific Thread/Topic IDs in Telegram forum groups
- Task migration via clipboard export/import with duplicate skipping
- Telegram Bot notifications, keyword-match notifications, and pre-task invalid-session detection
- Visual logs with per-run flow details and latest bot replies
- Stability improvements for timeout/429 scenarios and long-running memory behavior
- Docker-first deployment (easy to start and migrate)

## Feature Map

| Area | Capability |
| --- | --- |
| Account management | Multi-account login, proxy settings, status checks, re-login |
| Task workflows | Fixed or random-range schedules, ordered actions, action interval |
| Topic support | Send and filter replies by Telegram group `Thread ID` |
| Keyword monitoring | Push matches via Telegram Bot, Forward, Bark, or custom URL |
| Operations | Docker deployment, persistent data directory, health checks, config import/export |

## Beginner Deployment (3 Steps)

1. Install Docker
2. Run the container command below
3. Open `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080` in a browser and log in

Default credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

### One-command Deploy

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name tg-signpulse \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/data \
  -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai \
  -e APP_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key \
  ghcr.io/akasls/tg-signpulse:latest
```

If you use a reverse proxy, bind locally only:

```bash
-p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080
```

### Docker Compose (Optional)

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/akasls/tg-signpulse:latest
    container_name: tg-signpulse
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      - TZ=Asia/Shanghai
      - APP_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

## Data Directory & Permissions

- Default data directory: `/data`
- If `/data` is not writable, app falls back to `/tmp/tg-signpulse` (non-persistent)
- New images can auto-adapt runtime UID/GID to `/data` owner in most VPS setups (usually no need for `chmod 777`)

Container checks:

```bash
id
ls -ld /data
touch /data/.probe && rm /data/.probe
```

## Common Environment Variables

- `APP_SECRET_KEY`: panel secret key (strongly recommended)
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: initial default password for the admin user (strongly recommended, otherwise defaults to insecure 'admin123')
- `APP_HOST`: API listening interface (defaults to `127.0.0.1` for security; use `0.0.0.0` if exposing container globally)
- `APP_DATA_DIR`: custom data directory (higher priority than panel setting)
- `TG_PROXY`: Telegram connection proxy; you can also configure a global proxy in the panel
- `TG_SESSION_MODE`: `file` (default) or `string` (recommended on arm64)
- `TG_SESSION_NO_UPDATES`: set `1` to enable `no_updates` (`string` mode only)
- `TG_GLOBAL_CONCURRENCY`: global concurrency limit (default `1`)
- `APP_TOTP_VALID_WINDOW`: panel 2FA tolerance window

## Custom Data Directory

You can set the data directory in two ways:

1. Panel: `System Settings -> Global Sign-in Settings -> Data Directory`
2. Env var: `APP_DATA_DIR=/your/path`

Notes:
- Restart backend service after changing it
- The path must be writable and mounted as persistent volume

## Local Development

- Python 3.12 is recommended; supported versions are Python `>=3.10,<3.14`
- Python 3.14 or newer is not recommended because the Telegram/Pydantic runtime dependencies are not fully compatible yet
- The frontend uses Node.js 20; run `npm ci` inside `frontend/`

## Common Panel Settings

In `System Settings -> Global Sign-in Settings`, you can configure:

- Global Proxy: used by login, chat refresh, and task execution when an account has no dedicated proxy
- Telegram Bot Notifications: set Bot Token and target Chat ID to receive failed-task, invalid-account-session, or keyword-match alerts
- Data Directory: stores sessions, logs, database, and task files

On the account task page, you can:

- Fill in `Topic / Thread ID` so a task only runs inside a specific Telegram group topic
- Add `Keyword Monitor` to an ordered action sequence, then choose Telegram Bot, Forward, Bark, or custom URL from the `Push Channel` dropdown
- Forward, Bark, and custom URL parameters are only shown after selecting the matching push channel
- Click the top-right export icon to copy all tasks of the current account to the clipboard
- Click the top-right paste/import action to bulk-import tasks from the clipboard while skipping duplicates

## Health Checks

- `GET /healthz`: quick health endpoint
- `GET /readyz`: readiness endpoint

## Changelog

### 2026-04-29

- **Keyword Monitor Continue Actions**: `Push Channel` now includes `Continue Actions`. After a keyword match, the monitor can continue with an action sequence, including send text, click button, dice, AI vision, and AI calculation. Text actions support quick variables such as `{keyword}`, `{message}`, `{sender}`, `{chat_title}`, and `{url}`.
- **Telegram Bot Notification Refactor**: Telegram Bot notifications now live in their own Settings component, with a master switch, login notification switch, and task failure notification switch. When login notifications are enabled, every panel login sends the login IP to Telegram.
- **Per-task Failure Notification Control**: Create/edit task dialogs now include a default-enabled `Failure Notify` checkbox beside the title. Disabling it prevents that task from sending Telegram failure notifications even when global failure notifications are enabled.
- **Task Execution and Log Accuracy Fixes**: Fixed account cards getting stuck on "checking", moved account status checks to task execution time, ensured legacy tasks execute after peer preheating instead of being falsely reported as successful, and repaired common mojibake in historical logs.
- **Legacy Sign Task Scheduling Restored**: The scheduler now supports the older `signs/<task>/config.json` layout again, so startup sync correctly discovers and schedules those tasks. Old tasks without `account_name` are matched to existing sessions when possible, without migrating or rewriting user configuration.
- **More Reliable Button Clicking**: Button text matching now uses Unicode normalization and ignores symbols, spaces, and emoji. Matching works in both directions, inline button clicks have a `Message.click` fallback, and callback retry handling now covers timeout/connection errors up to 5 attempts.
- **Scheduler Robustness Fix**: Sign task sync skips malformed entries that have no account or task name, avoiding invalid jobs while leaving healthy tasks unaffected.
- **Frontend Build Config Fix**: The `/api` rewrite remains available for development, while production static export no longer declares ineffective rewrites, removing the Next.js build warning.
- **Full Project Verification**: Verified with `python -m compileall backend tg_signer`, `pytest -q`, `python -m ruff check .`, `python -m pip check`, frontend `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`. The local machine only has Python 3.14 installed, where importing the Telegram runtime hits an upstream `pyrogram/kurigram` compatibility error; the production Docker image uses Python 3.12, and local development should use Python `>=3.10,<3.14`.

### 2026-04-28

- **Pre-task Account Status Check**: Sign tasks now verify the account session before execution. If the session is confirmed invalid, tasks for that account are skipped instead of being reported as successful.
- **Invalid-session Notification and Persistent State**: Invalid accounts are persisted in account metadata and reported through the Telegram Bot notification settings. Repeated tasks under the same invalid state do not spam duplicate alerts.
- **Dashboard Re-login Flow**: Account cards now show `Session Invalid` in the lower-left status area, and clicking an invalid account opens the re-login dialog directly instead of relying on the older "all tasks failed" heuristic.
- **Task Log Encoding Fix**: Runtime logs, historical log reads, and account log exports now consistently use UTF-8 and repair common mojibake in older stored entries.
- **Python Version Constraint**: Project metadata now requires Python `>=3.10,<3.14`, matching the Python 3.12 Docker image and preventing installs on incompatible interpreters.
- **Project Health Check**: Verified with `compileall`, `pytest`, `ruff check .`, frontend `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`.

### 2026-04-27

- **Keyword Monitor Action**: Keyword monitoring now lives in the account task ordered action sequence, so it can be configured per task, account, chat, and topic.
- **Keyword Monitor Interaction**: Forwarding now lives inside the `Push Channel` dropdown. Forward Chat ID/topic fields only appear for Forward, while Bark and custom URL fields only appear for their own channels.
- **Action Sequence Layout**: Each action now uses a clearer `index + action type + parameters + delete` structure, with keyword monitor parameters grouped into a compact two-column layout.
- **Target Chat Form Layout**: `Topic / Thread ID (Optional)` now sits on the same row as manual Chat ID in both create and edit dialogs.
- **Matched Message Forwarding**: Matched messages can be forwarded to a target Chat ID, with optional topic/thread ID support.

### 2026-04-26

- **Telegram Topic (Thread) Support**: Tasks can now run inside a specific topic of a specific group. Sent messages include `message_thread_id`, and incoming replies from other topics are ignored.
- **Global Proxy Fallback**: Added a Global Proxy setting. Login, chat refresh, scheduled/manual task execution, and legacy CLI execution use it whenever an account does not have its own proxy.
- **Clipboard Bulk Import/Export**: The account task page now has top-right actions to export all tasks to the clipboard and paste-import tasks. Imports skip duplicates and attach imported tasks to the current account.
- **Convenient Re-login Experience**: The account edit modal now includes a Re-login action with complete Chinese/English labels, allowing users to refresh an existing account session directly.
- **Telegram Bot Notifications**: System Settings now include notification enablement, Bot Token, and notification Chat ID. Failed tasks send account, task, error, and recent log context; keyword matches can also use the same Bot API channel.
- **Dashboard Invalid-Session Hint**: If every task under an account failed in its latest run, the dashboard marks the account as session invalid and guides users to re-login.
- **Frontend Task Log Improvements**: Per-run task flow logs retain more lines and are shown directly in the frontend task history.
- **Project Health Cleanup**: Fixed simple Ruff findings and made root debug scripts safe for pytest collection.

### 2026-03-20
- **SQLite Database Deadlock Fixed**: Hardened the Pyrogram client lifecycle cache, completely eliminating the overlapping `database is locked` errors previously caused by concurrent UI polling overlapping with worker queues. Background executions now smoothly multiplex SQLite connections, resulting in significantly lower I/O and zero queuing deadlocks.
- **Task Prevention UI**: Improved the frontend with protection logic against double-calling tasks. If the user accidentally clicks 'Run' on an actively executing task, the app will gracefully block the action, display a warning that the task is currently in progress, and immediately pivot to streaming its live logs instead.

### 2026-03-19

- **Account Status Display Fix**: Fixed a frontend string-matching bug where completely normal accounts were erroneously displayed as "Account Invalid".
- **Old Account Execution Fix**: Resolved critical `PeerIdInvalid` execution crashes for older local `.session` file-based accounts. The task engine was mistakenly defaulting them into an in-memory session mode overriding their reliable local SQLite database, resulting in a loss of tracked peers. Now, caching and cross-account task copying are highly stable.
- **Bot Final Reply Extraction**: Enhanced log parsing engine. During successful message exchanges, the engine automatically extracts the final reply text from the target signed-bot and presents it beautifully in both the frontend run logs and execution table, keeping the UI intact. 
- **Code Linter**: Ran full project health & Ruff linter checks, safely pruning dead code.

### 2026-03-12
- Core stability fix: Fixed a severe memory leak and high network I/O issue caused by Pyrogram timeout & `FloodWait` infinite retry loops leading to async lock starvation and unretrieved task exceptions.

### 2026-03-06

- Action sequence order optimized: `Send Text -> Click Text Button -> Send Dice -> AI Vision -> AI Calculate`.
- AI actions refined: `AI Vision` and `AI Calculate` now support inline sub-modes (send text / click button).
- Task copy/paste UX improved:
  - Copy now opens a config dialog with one-click copy.
  - Top-right paste import tries clipboard first; falls back to manual paste dialog when unavailable.
- Task log dialog improved: now shows `Task: XXX succeeded/failed` and the latest bot reply.
- Dashboard status checks improved on page open/refresh to reduce false "Check Failed".
- Mobile/layout polish: task card action area is more compact, action-row control heights are unified.
- UTF-8 export fix: resolved task copy/export errors with emoji content.
- Container permission compatibility improved with `/data` owner UID/GID adaptation.

### 2026-03-01

- AI action upgrade, AI config save fix, and phone code login changed to manual confirmation.
- Reduced frequent `TimeoutError` and `429 transport flood` logs.
- Long-running stability and memory optimizations.
- Added custom data directory support.
